# Starbound-Legacy-Edition
A fan-made legacy project restoring the charm of Starbound’s Alpha and Beta builds — from old biomes and items to long-lost mechanics.


Tutorial:

Tools:

- [Love2D](https://love2d.org/wiki/Main_Page) Optional, for prototyping pure Lua logic or AI behavior outside of Starbound/
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Required, use add-ons for Lua and C++. Recommended.
- [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) Required, but has a one-time payment.
- [Libresprite](https://libresprite.github.io/#!/) Optional, the free alternative of Aseprite, but slightly behind in features and updates.

**Disclaimer!**
You must own Starbound to mod the game. Cracked versions are for educational purposes only and are not supported.

This mod may require access to older Alpha/Beta builds. Please ensure you legally own these versions.
