# Starbound-Legacy-Edition
A fan-made legacy project restoring the charm of Starbound’s Alpha and Beta builds — from old biomes and items to long-lost mechanics.

Tools:

- [Love2D](https://love2d.org/wiki/Main_Page) Optional, for prototyping pure Lua logic or AI behavior outside of Starbound
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Required, use add-ons for Lua and C++. Recommended.
- [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) Required, but has a one-time payment.
- [Libresprite](https://libresprite.github.io/#!/) Optional, the free alternative of Aseprite, but slightly behind in features and updates.
- [Pixelorama](https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama) Optional, a powerful and accessible open-source pixel art multitool.
- [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/app/211820/depots/) Required, has the oldest/latest manifests and builds.

**Disclaimer!**
You must own Starbound to mod the game. Cracked versions are not supported.

This mod may require access to older Alpha/Beta builds.
